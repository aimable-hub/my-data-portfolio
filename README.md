# 📊 My Data Analytics Portfolio  

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! 🚀  
I am currently pursuing my **MS in Data Analytics at EU**, where I am building strong skills in data cleaning, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.  

This repository serves as a **hub of my projects and learning journey** — showcasing how I use tools like **Python, SQL, R, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI** to turn raw data into actionable insights.
